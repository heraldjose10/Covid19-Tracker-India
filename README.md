# Covid19-Tracker-India
This is python script that uses API made by Chris Michael.
This build of the script provides statistics about active cases,deaths,recoveries and the time at which data was updated.

# About accuracy of Data Provided
I used the best API available(At the time of creation) for the build.Credits to Chris Michael for the API.
Personally I dont think the data is precisely accurate because its only updated a few times a day.
